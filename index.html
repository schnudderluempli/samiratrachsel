          so, somehow you ended up here. by accident or by choice? either way, I hope you stay for a bit. or get in contact :)

          I do all kinds of designs, but something I‘m really good at is food. driven by the latest food trends around the globe yet very curious about culinaric traditions and cultures, I love to bring a certain facet of concept and design into my work. caterings, food installations and everything in between that you  already have in mind - or not yet! (that‘s mostly when I take over)

          besides my passion for collecting recipes, adapting them and endlessly turning them into new ones, I love to play around with food. why not play with food a little more? of course as long as it will be shared and appreciated. my admiration and curiosity for flavours, textures, colors and origins have a big influence on the work I do.     
        </p>
        <p>                                                           
          and the bachelor’s degree in design and trend research (that I’m currently doing), might also help with keeping up with the lastest trends in and around the food cosmos :)
